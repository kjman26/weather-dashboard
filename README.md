Purpose:
    The purpose of this assignment is to create a workable weather tracking website using an api to gather, store, and provide data on the user's search. 

Functionality:
    The app will allow users to choose a location by city that will then provide them with a detailed description of that area's weather and a five-day forecast labeled with the dates.

    The website is intuitive and only requires the user to search a city and will recieve the weather for the next today and the next 5 days.


What I Learned:
    I learned how to call on an api to grab data from a website. How to generate a key that will allow that api's information to be called upon.
